<h2> About me:</h2>
<p> I am a recent B.S. Grad from Texas A&M University. For the past 7 months, I have been a data systems coordinator for a Clinical Education Company.
I recently delved full into networking as the future of my career path, and I am using <b>THIS GITHUB</b>  to show the progress, the learning, the failures, and successes of my journey</p>
